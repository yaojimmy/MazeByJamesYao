/**
 * Class handles the user interaction
 * while the game is in the first stage
 * where the user can select the skill-level.
 * This class is part of a state pattern for the
 * Controller class. It is a ConcreteState.
 * 
 * It implements a state-dependent behavior
 * that controls the display and reacts to
 * key board input from a user. 
 * At this point user keyboard input is first dealt
 * with a key listener (SimpleKeyListener)
 * and then handed over to a Controller object
 * by way of the keyDown method.
 * 
 * Responsibilities:
 * Show the title screen,
 * Accept input for skill level,  
 * Switch to the generating screen,
 * If given a filename, pass it on to the generating screen
